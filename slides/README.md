## ClojureBridge slides

These slides are written with Hoplon, a ClojureScript-to-HTML
compiler, using Reveal.js for displaying slides.

In order to build the slides, you need the Clojure build tool boot
installed. See Boot's "Getting Started" section for installation
instructions.

After installing boot, you can run boot development to compile the
Hoplon code, watch the code for changes, and show the output on
http://localhost:8000/ via Ring. You can run boot hoplon to just
compile the Hoplon code.
